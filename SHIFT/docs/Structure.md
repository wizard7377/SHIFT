The project is primarly structed into four componements:

- The Representation for Intutionistic Flat Theorems (RIFT), the middle end
- The Solver for Intuitionistic Flat Theorems (SIFT), the back end
- The Languages for Intuitionistic Flat Theorems (LIFT), the parser
- the Handler for Intuitionistic Flat Theorems (HIFT), the front end

All of these are intended to be minimally interconnected, such that changes to one can be made without regard to the others
