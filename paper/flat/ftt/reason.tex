\section{Reasoning in Flat Type Theory}

As mentioned previously, Flat Type Theory revolves primary around the $:$ constructor, as opposed to the $\to$ constructor primarly used in Heirachal Type Theory.
There are many differences apart from this, but they can all be summed up as the fact that Flat Type Theory is implicit.
That is, a proof in Hierarchal Type Theory is an applications of tactics to hypothesizes, while in Flat Type Theory propositions are are show by rules applied to statements.

For instance, take the $\lambda$ constructor of Heirachal Type Theory (and $\lambda$ calculus).
When we say $\lambda x.M$, we are describing a function to something that, when applied to some $x$, gives $M$.
The equivalent in Flat Type Theory is $\lamed x (M)$ which rather then being applied to things instead reperesents a statement that is a generalization of $M$
