\section{An Overview of Flat Type Theory}

Before looking at \emph{Flat} Type Theory, let us first take a look at Classical Type Theory and Prolog.
Let us take the axiom in Peano Arithmetic $a = b \vdash S(a) = S(b)$, that is, the successesor function is one-to-one.
If we were to write this in Classical Type Theory (giving it the name  \verb|seq|), we might write it as $seq :: a = b \to S(a) = S(b)$
